      <div class="ps-3 text-dark">
       
<p><strong>Institutional Skills Development:</strong>We design and deliver training programs focused on strengthening the procurement competencies of government agencies, PIUs, and donor-funded institutions. Topics include public procurement laws, tendering processes, and contract management, tailored to align with both national and international standards.</p>

<p><strong>Training for Tender Committees & Evaluation Panels:</strong>Our workshops equip tender committee members with the skills to manage procurement processes transparently and efficiently. We cover evaluation techniques, risk mitigation in supplier selection, and ethical standards in procurement.</p>


<p><strong>Procurement Planning & Budgeting Workshops:</strong>We guide participants through the full cycle of procurement planning — from needs assessment and market analysis to procurement method selection and budgeting. Participants gain tools to draft realistic, fundable procurement plans.
